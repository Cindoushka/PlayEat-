# PlayEat!

PlayEat! is an application we've been working on durint our Apple Foundation Program in a team of 3.
I'm still working on it so the project we'll be fully done by myself. 

Our theme was "Cuisine" and we choosed to develop an application to make people want to cook again, or more thanks to a little game. 
We wanted too to make people discover new recipes, coming from different countries. 

We also had a social dimension, with a ranking and a chat.
